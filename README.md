# eQTL-mapping
Software to map eQTLs, (cis- and trans-eQTLs), as well as sQTLs by comparing gene expression data with genotype data with R's Matrix eQTL package. This software, as a whole, can:
- map basic eQTLs
- map cis- and trans-eQTLs
- map sQTLs
- prepare data sets for Matrix eQTL input
- calculate MAF

**This software is still under development**

## Set-up
Your gene expression data file and your genotype data file should be prepared for input into the Matrix eQTL package. By doing so, the data created will be saved in `/data_preparation/RData/`.

_How do we prepare data?_
* Open a terminal in the R project (root folder).
* Run the following command: >Rscript --vanilla ./data_preparation/prepare_data.R “your_genotype_data“ “your_gene_expression_data” 
* The resulting `*.RData` file will appear in the `/RData/` folder.
* Next your SNP and Gene position files should be set-up. They have to have the exact format described [here](http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/Matrix_eQTL/Sample_Data/snpsloc.txt) for SNP positions and [here](http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/Matrix_eQTL/Sample_Data/geneloc.txt) for Gene positions.

### Mapping basic eQTLs
* Run: >Rscript --vanilla ./analysis/basic_eQTL.R
* The results are now in your `/Users/your_name/Documents/R-Output/basic` folder.

### Mapping cis- and trans-eQTLs
* Run: >Rscript --vanilla ./analysis/cis-trans-eQTL.R “your_gene_positions” “your_snp_positions” “location_to_RData_file” “cis_treshold_e.g._1e-5” “trans_treshold_e.g.1e-5” “cisDist_e.g._1e6” 
* The results are now in your `/Users/your_name/Documents/R-Output/cis` & `/Users/your_name/Documents/R-Output/trans` folder.
